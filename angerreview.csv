" ""Pisses me off I paid $40 for the yearly so my 2 year old can get full access and 99% of the time you click on something it doesn't open until I hit the screen 450 times.....I want a damn refund"""
"""I really like the content but don't make us download again all the features with this update!!! It's taking a lot of time. Or have a button that downloads everything! Also you should add an option that will remove a feature if you don't like it anymore. Please fix this. This update is so annoying. And it won't update or download in the background. You have to have it on your screen all the time!!!"""
"""I'm very frustrated with the new update. It doesnt seem to register my subscription that only expires in Sep17 except if I go through playstore and everything that was perviously downloaded has to be redownloaded as it seems that the memory has been wiped. Data is not always available to redownload so really unhappy. This is my 2 year old son's favourite app but unfortunately there are nothing for him to watch now. :("""
"""I would buy the app for reasonable price, but 5 bucks a month subscription is way out of line, even for a complex baby app. It is almost the price of my Netflix monthly fee. Ridiculous. And unfortunately the in-app ads for subscription are so agresive that it is impossible for a kid to use it in free mode."""
" ""Very bad app can't download everything because it's locked. If it is for babies then why to subscribe? Very unfair!"""
" ""Thought this was a one off purchase, but it has been taking money from my account MONTHLY and we couldnt use it because it didnt work. Would like to apply for a refund please, or will take this complaint further."""
"""90% features are locked. So its ridiculous"""
"""Not bad... Purchasing option may be avoided"" "
"""It crashes again and again... need to fix it i will give 5 stars...i have 3gb ram still doesn't open and crashes .."""
I wanted to give zero star rating .plz dont download it all of the things are locked
fully bad
The prices are ridiculous for kids app. My baby is one and paying 399 is just too much
Too bad
Will update rating as son uses the games
Kepps on hanging after the update
Not bad
I do not always want to spend money on this game
Why make it cost money
Horrible
"Great matetrial always being added. Lots of fun for kids. Very bright, colorful, and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate or ads popping up. Keeps my Son occupied when ever it is tablet time!"
"Awesome app, worth the money once all features are available!! ?"
I do not always want to spend money on this game
Great game just wish there wasnt a subscription fee would have bought if it was a one time thing.
Very playful app for toddlers
Love it bad
Not bad..want one mnth free trial
Will update rating as son uses the games
"Very useful for kids,stepping stone"
Kepps on hanging after the update
Free stuff is great and even for subscribing 99 per month is not bad. 24 free rhythms and 2 free games. Nice animation. A must have for a parent to keep a toddler occupied.
Not bad
IT'S BAD
"Good features, bad implementation. Requires excessive downloads and space, and is buggy. E.g. we were paying a subscription but the app kept saying we were on their trial version. Following their help instructions didn't work."
Dont download this app need to pay!!!! Hate this apps!!!
"I tried out the trial and didn't like it so I deleted the App. Today, I noticed there was money deducted from my account. I really would like to have my money back as I have not enjoyed the App. How can I go about that?"
A nice app with some really good songs. It's just a shame about the price to unlock the rest of the songs. $39.99 is ridiculous! I was expecting something like ?4.99 to unlock the rest of the songs for ever. I won't be paying for the full version!
"The content in and of itself is fairly extensive and cute, the graphics are colorful which my 4m old loves and they have a nice-sized library overall. With that being said, though they have subtitles for the music, the words are very difficult to understand. The main reason for my 3-star review is price. I completely understand the company has production costs, and other misc expenses but I just feel like$5/month ($60 a year!) for access to content that isn't like a periodical where it's new every month is outrageous. While the library is extensive, keep in mind they're all short little nursery rhymes, not full length movies. For the same price, you can get a low-tiered Netflix subscription. As I mentioned, I'm sympathetic to your insistence of production costs, but maybe charging a flat rate of$5 to buy the app outright would be more reasonable and realistic. There's other apps on the same level as this one who are just about equal in terms of quality and quantity of content that don't charge anything. I'm not trying to be rude, but rather just wanted to offer a little insight. It's a very cute app though and I can see the effort that was involved in making it, and as a textiles artist myself, I completely understand not wanting to sell yourself short but just something to think about."
Constant upgrade adds are annoying
Great app but i am not willing to pay yearly. A once off fee seems more reasonable..
"Well i thought this app was awsome until i found that you have to pay to have everything in the app, your discription is very misleading you should change it to 40 free songs etc, not over 1000 songs and games etc. This app shouldnt be in the free catagorie unless you change the name to 40 free songs etc."
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE PAYMENT FOR UNLOCK THINGS ARE YOU SO MUCH GREEDY I HATE IT AND HAVE DELETED IT
You just keep downloading each song afresh after downloading the full package. Very annoying!
All the things are locked I hate it
I hate this game ?????????

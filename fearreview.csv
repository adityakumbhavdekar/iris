"1","Why was Itsy bitsy spider rhyme changed. It was my son's favourite. Now my son cries whenever he opens it and he doesnt see what he expects. Moreover, it's not like the new one is any better than the old one. I'll ignore updates next time to avoid such."
"2","The content in and of itself is fairly extensive and cute, the graphics are colorful which my 4m old loves and they have a nice-sized library overall. With that being said, though they have subtitles for the music, the words are very difficult to understand. The main reason for my 3-star review is price. I completely understand the company has production costs, and other misc expenses but I just feel like$5/month ($60 a year!) for access to content that isn't like a periodical where it's new every month is outrageous. While the library is extensive, keep in mind they're all short little nursery rhymes, not full length movies. For the same price, you can get a low-tiered Netflix subscription. As I mentioned, I'm sympathetic to your insistence of production costs, but maybe charging a flat rate of$5 to buy the app outright would be more reasonable and realistic. There's other apps on the same level as this one who are just about equal in terms of quality and quantity of content that don't charge anything. I'm not trying to be rude, but rather just wanted to offer a little insight. It's a very cute app though and I can see the effort that was involved in making it, and as a textiles artist myself, I completely understand not wanting to sell yourself short but just something to think about."
"3","My baby likes to watch it."
"4","I really like the content but don't make us download again all the features with this update!!! It's taking a lot of time. Or have a button that downloads everything! Also you should add an option that will remove a feature if you don't like it anymore. Please fix this. This update is so annoying. And it won't update or download in the background. You have to have it on your screen all the time!!!"
"5","I'm very frustrated with the new update. It doesnt seem to register my subscription that only expires in Sep17 except if I go through playstore and everything that was perviously downloaded has to be redownloaded as it seems that the memory has been wiped. Data is not always available to redownload so really unhappy. This is my 2 year old son's favourite app but unfortunately there are nothing for him to watch now. :("
"6","Not bad... Purchasing option may be avoided"
"7","It's good but i think the game is lil hard to be understand for 3-4 years old kid. Also the download loading is not good since i must download everytime my nephew want to watch nursery rhymes and play games. I hopes you can improve this. Maybe you just need to download bigger file from google play and then all is availabe in the apps. Thank you."
"8","Unsafe. Says free but it's paid. For free trial also takes cc details not feel secure"

"10","I wanted to give zero star rating .plz dont download it all of the things are locked"
"11","fully bad"
"12","Too bad"
"13","Will update rating as son uses the games"
"14","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"15","Not bad"
"16","Horrible"
"17","Great matetrial always being added. Lots of fun for kids. Very bright, colorful, and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate or ads popping up. Keeps my Son occupied when ever it is tablet time!"
"18","Very educational and fun to watch"
"19","Love it bad"
"20","Not bad..want one mnth free trial"
"21","Will update rating as son uses the games"
"22","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"23","Free stuff is great and even for subscribing 99 per month is not bad. 24 free rhythms and 2 free games. Nice animation. A must have for a parent to keep a toddler occupied."
"24","Not bad"
"25","IT'S BAD"
"26","Good features, bad implementation. Requires excessive downloads and space, and is buggy. E.g. we were paying a subscription but the app kept saying we were on their trial version. Following their help instructions didn't work."
"27","Dont download this app need to pay!!!! Hate this apps!!!"
"28","A nice app with some really good songs. It's just a shame about the price to unlock the rest of the songs. $39.99 is ridiculous! I was expecting something like £4.99 to unlock the rest of the songs for ever. I won't be paying for the full version!"
"29","Good app akfani shame"
"30","Worse waste of time ever spent. May be decent if you can spend half a day away from your child trying to download every little thing needed to make it work. And then subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. Free? B.S."
"31","Very bad app can't download everything because it's locked. If it is for babies then why to subscribe? Very unfair!"
"32","Well i thought this app was awsome until i found that you have to pay to have everything in the app, your discription is very misleading you should change it to 40 free songs etc, not over 1000 songs and games etc. This app shouldnt be in the free catagorie unless you change the name to 40 free songs etc."
"33","Soòooooooooooooooooooooooooo worse game"
"34","IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE PAYMENT FOR UNLOCK THINGS ARE YOU SO MUCH GREEDY I HATE IT AND HAVE DELETED IT"
"35","All the things are locked I hate it"
"36","I hate this game ?????????"
"37","Its a paid app. Aed 14/month. It has a free trail period of 7 days but it doesn't really make a change for me. Am not sure if its really worth paying so much as there are many other good rhymes apps for free."
"38","Hopeless app"

"1","The content in and of itself is fairly extensive and cute, the graphics are colorful which my 4m old loves and they have a nice-sized library overall. With that being said, though they have subtitles for the music, the words are very difficult to understand. The main reason for my 3-star review is price. I completely understand the company has production costs, and other misc expenses but I just feel like$5/month ($60 a year!) for access to content that isn't like a periodical where it's new every month is outrageous. While the library is extensive, keep in mind they're all short little nursery rhymes, not full length movies. For the same price, you can get a low-tiered Netflix subscription. As I mentioned, I'm sympathetic to your insistence of production costs, but maybe charging a flat rate of$5 to buy the app outright would be more reasonable and realistic. There's other apps on the same level as this one who are just about equal in terms of quality and quantity of content that don't charge anything. I'm not trying to be rude, but rather just wanted to offer a little insight. It's a very cute app though and I can see the effort that was involved in making it, and as a textiles artist myself, I completely understand not wanting to sell yourself short but just something to think about."
"2","Great matetrial always being added. Lots of fun for kids. Very bright, colorful, and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate or ads popping up. Keeps my Son occupied when ever it is tablet time!"
"3","Very bad app can't download everything because it's locked. If it is for babies then why to subscribe? Very unfair!"
"4","I really like the content but don't make us download again all the features with this update!!! It's taking a lot of time. Or have a button that downloads everything! Also you should add an option that will remove a feature if you don't like it anymore. Please fix this. This update is so annoying. And it won't update or download in the background. You have to have it on your screen all the time!!!"
"5","I'm very frustrated with the new update. It doesnt seem to register my subscription that only expires in Sep17 except if I go through playstore and everything that was perviously downloaded has to be redownloaded as it seems that the memory has been wiped. Data is not always available to redownload so really unhappy. This is my 2 year old son's favourite app but unfortunately there are nothing for him to watch now. :("
"6","Not bad... Purchasing option may be avoided"
"7","Its a great app was sick of other ones that you could only use online last I want to do is let my 2 year old go on the net wish there were a few more songs like wheels on the bus"
"8","Not sure why but 3yr old grandson was not interested"
"9","I wanted to give zero star rating .plz dont download it all of the things are locked"
"10","fully bad"

"12","Sadly I don't have any card so no way to buy other songs..."
"13","Will update rating as son uses the games"
"14","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"15","Not bad"
"16","I would buy the app for reasonable price, but 5 bucks a month subscription is way out of line, even for a complex baby app. It is almost the price of my Netflix monthly fee. Ridiculous. And unfortunately the in-app ads for subscription are so agresive that it is impossible for a kid to use it in free mode."
"17","Lovely app"
"18","Sadly I don't have any card so no way to buy other songs..."

"28","Will update rating as son uses the games"
"29","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"30","Free stuff is great and even for subscribing 99 per month is not bad. 24 free rhythms and 2 free games. Nice animation. A must have for a parent to keep a toddler occupied."
"31","It's lovely. Very entertaining"
"32","Not bad"
"33","IT'S BAD"
"34","Good features, bad implementation. Requires excessive downloads and space, and is buggy. E.g. we were paying a subscription but the app kept saying we were on their trial version. Following their help instructions didn't work."
"35","Dont download this app need to pay!!!! Hate this apps!!!"
"36","A nice app with some really good songs. It's just a shame about the price to unlock the rest of the songs. $39.99 is ridiculous! I was expecting something like £4.99 to unlock the rest of the songs for ever. I won't be paying for the full version!"
"37","Good app akfani shame"
"38","Worse waste of time ever spent. May be decent if you can spend half a day away from your child trying to download every little thing needed to make it work. And then subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. Free? B.S."
"39","Soòooooooooooooooooooooooooo worse game"
"40","IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE PAYMENT FOR UNLOCK THINGS ARE YOU SO MUCH GREEDY I HATE IT AND HAVE DELETED IT"
"41","All the things are locked I hate it"

"1","A nice app with some really good songs. It's just a shame about the price to unlock the rest of the songs. $39.99 is ridiculous! I was expecting something like £4.99 to unlock the rest of the songs for ever. I won't be paying for the full version!"
"2","Very bad app can't download everything because it's locked. If it is for babies then why to subscribe? Very unfair!"
"3","IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE PAYMENT FOR UNLOCK THINGS ARE YOU SO MUCH GREEDY I HATE IT AND HAVE DELETED IT"
"4","This game is boring it is soooooo slooow like an sloth"
"5","Total tym waste"
"6","I've subscribed but I couldn't even download stuff. Wasted my money."
"7","90% features are locked. So its ridiculous"
"8","Pisses me off I paid $40 for the yearly so my 2 year old can get full access and 99% of the time you click on something it doesn't open until I hit the screen 450 times.....I want a damn refund"
"9","I'm very frustrated with the new update. It doesnt seem to register my subscription that only expires in Sep17 except if I go through playstore and everything that was perviously downloaded has to be redownloaded as it seems that the memory has been wiped. Data is not always available to redownload so really unhappy. This is my 2 year old son's favourite app but unfortunately there are nothing for him to watch now. :("
"10","Not bad... Purchasing option may be avoided"
"11","Too expensive monthly Boy loves it but i wont be paying for it monthly"
"12","Its a great app was sick of other ones that you could only use online last I want to do is let my 2 year old go on the net wish there were a few more songs like wheels on the bus"
"13","Not sure why but 3yr old grandson was not interested"
"14","Didn't explicitly stated paid subscription. Waste of time"
"15","fully bad"
"16","The prices are ridiculous for kids app. My baby is one and paying 399 is just too much"
"17","Too bad"
"18","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"19","Not bad"
"20","I would buy the app for reasonable price, but 5 bucks a month subscription is way out of line, even for a complex baby app. It is almost the price of my Netflix monthly fee. Ridiculous. And unfortunately the in-app ads for subscription are so agresive that it is impossible for a kid to use it in free mode."
"21","Horrible"
"22","Great matetrial always being added. Lots of fun for kids. Very bright, colorful, and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate or ads popping up. Keeps my Son occupied when ever it is tablet time!"
"23","Me n my baby boy love this songs"
"24","My boy lik it"
"25","I would buy the app for reasonable price, but 5 bucks a month subscription is way out of line, even for a complex baby app. It is almost the price of my Netflix monthly fee. Ridiculous.

"26","Love it bad"
"27","Its great my boy loves it touching the pictures and they do different little movements and things and a variety of songs great"
"28","This app forces you to subscribe. inadvertently click subscribe. I no longer have the app on my phone and am still being billed $ 7 a month. All my attempts to contact them met with no response or reply. These people are crooks. I finally figured out how to unsubscribe. Not happy."
"29","My Baby Boy Likes It So Much"
"30","Not bad..want one mnth free trial"
"31","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"32","Free stuff is great and even for subscribing 99 per month is not bad. 24 free rhythms and 2 free games. Nice animation. A must have for a parent to keep a toddler occupied."
"33","Not bad"
"34","IT'S BAD"
"35","Idiot"
"36","Why was Itsy bitsy spider rhyme changed. It was my son's favourite. Now my son cries whenever he opens it and he doesnt see what he expects. Moreover, it's not like the new one is any better than the old one. I'll ignore updates next time to avoid such."
"37","Good features, bad implementation. Requires excessive downloads and space, and is buggy. E.g. we were paying a subscription but the app kept saying we were on their trial version. Following their help instructions didn't work."
"38","Dont download this app need to pay!!!! Hate this apps!!!"
"39","Good app akfani shame"
"40","Waste of time"
"41","Worse waste of time ever spent. May be decent if you can spend half a day away from your child trying to download every little thing needed to make it work. And then subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. Free? B.S."
"42","Waste of my mobile data, almost all rhyms, stories are locked. My child could not understand vocal sounds."
"43","This app is garbage"
"44","Well i thought this app was awsome until i found that you have to pay to have everything in the app, your discription is very misleading you should change it to 40 free songs etc, not over 1000 songs and games etc. This app shouldnt be in the free catagorie unless you change the name to 40 free songs etc."
"45","All the things are locked I hate it"
"46","I hate this game ?????????"

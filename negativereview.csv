"1","IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE PAYMENT FOR UNLOCK THINGS ARE YOU SO MUCH GREEDY I HATE IT AND HAVE DELETED IT"
"2","I would buy the app for reasonable price, but 5 bucks a month subscription is way out of line, even for a complex baby app. It is almost the price of my Netflix monthly fee. Ridiculous. And unfortunately the in-app ads for subscription are so agresive that it is impossible for a kid to use it in free mode."

"4","The content in and of itself is fairly extensive and cute, the graphics are colorful which my 4m old loves and they have a nice-sized library overall. With that being said, though they have subtitles for the music, the words are very difficult to understand. The main reason for my 3-star review is price. I completely understand the company has production costs, and other misc expenses but I just feel like$5/month ($60 a year!) for access to content that isn't like a periodical where it's new every month is outrageous. While the library is extensive, keep in mind they're all short little nursery rhymes, not full length movies. For the same price, you can get a low-tiered Netflix subscription. As I mentioned, I'm sympathetic to your insistence of production costs, but maybe charging a flat rate of$5 to buy the app outright would be more reasonable and realistic. There's other apps on the same level as this one who are just about equal in terms of quality and quantity of content that don't charge anything. I'm not trying to be rude, but rather just wanted to offer a little insight. It's a very cute app though and I can see the effort that was involved in making it, and as a textiles artist myself, I completely understand not wanting to sell yourself short but just something to think about."
"5","Worse waste of time ever spent. May be decent if you can spend half a day away from your child trying to download every little thing needed to make it work. And then subscribe, subscribe, subscribe. Free? B.S."
"6","i download this game but we have buy to listen or read stories so boring so don't dowload this game useless"
"7","This game is boring it is soooooo slooow like an sloth"
"8","Pisses me off I paid $40 for the yearly so my 2 year old can get full access and 99% of the time you click on something it doesn't open until I hit the screen 450 times.....I want a damn refund"
"9","I really like the content but don't make us download again all the features with this update!!! It's taking a lot of time. Or have a button that downloads everything! Also you should add an option that will remove a feature if you don't like it anymore. Please fix this. This update is so annoying. And it won't update or download in the background. You have to have it on your screen all the time!!!"
"10","I'm very frustrated with the new update. It doesnt seem to register my subscription that only expires in Sep17 except if I go through playstore and everything that was perviously downloaded has to be redownloaded as it seems that the memory has been wiped. Data is not always available to redownload so really unhappy. This is my 2 year old son's favourite app but unfortunately there are nothing for him to watch now. :("
"11","Great matetrial always being added. Lots of fun for kids. Very bright, colorful, and I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate or ads popping up. Keeps my Son occupied when ever it is tablet time!"
"12","Why was Itsy bitsy spider rhyme changed. It was my son's favourite. Now my son cries whenever he opens it and he doesnt see what he expects. Moreover, it's not like the new one is any better than the old one. I'll ignore updates next time to avoid such."
"13","A nice app with some really good songs. It's just a shame about the price to unlock the rest of the songs. $39.99 is ridiculous! I was expecting something like £4.99 to unlock the rest of the songs for ever. I won't be paying for the full version!"
"14","Very bad app can't download everything because it's locked. If it is for babies then why to subscribe? Very unfair!"
"15","Total tym waste"
"16","I've subscribed but I couldn't even download stuff. Wasted my money."
"17","90% features are locked. So its ridiculous"
"18","Not bad... Purchasing option may be avoided"
"19","Boring"
"20","$54 per year or every second swipe is a subscription ad giving you access to 5% of content. Don't bother downloading unless willing to pay monthly or yearly fees"
"21","If it is a paid game and trial version then y r u showing it free...???? I think previously it was free and was best... Nw everything is locked and ask for payment..."
"22","Unsafe. Says free but it's paid. For free trial also takes cc details not feel secure"
"23","Boring"
"24","Too expensive monthly Boy loves it but i wont be paying for it monthly"
"25","Its a great app was sick of other ones that you could only use online last I want to do is let my 2 year old go on the net wish there were a few more songs like wheels on the bus"
"26","It crashes again and again... need to fix it i will give 5 stars...i have 3gb ram still doesn't open and crashes .."
"27","With Payment"
"28","Didn't explicitly stated paid subscription. Waste of time"
"29","I wanted to give zero star rating .plz dont download it all of the things are locked"
"30","fully bad"
"31","The prices are ridiculous for kids app. My baby is one and paying 399 is just too much"

"44","Great game just wish there wasnt a subscription fee would have bought if it was a one time thing."
"45","Makes me rate it in order to try it.....something wrong with that picture."

"48","My Baby Boy Likes It So Much"
"49","Not bad..want one mnth free trial"
"50","Will update rating as son uses the games"
"51","Very useful for kids,stepping stone"
"52","Kepps on hanging after the update"
"53","Free stuff is great and even for subscribing 99 per month is not bad. 24 free rhythms and 2 free games. Nice animation. A must have for a parent to keep a toddler occupied."
"54","Subject has a great app for kids"
"55","Not bad"
"56","IT'S BAD"
"57","Idiot"
"58","Good features, bad implementation. Requires excessive downloads and space, and is buggy. E.g. we were paying a subscription but the app kept saying we were on their trial version. Following their help instructions didn't work."
"59","Dont download this app need to pay!!!! Hate this apps!!!"
"60","Can't try out the free trial without putting in payment method"
"61","Constant upgrade adds are annoying"
"62","Great app but i am not willing to pay yearly. A once off fee seems more reasonable.."
"63","Good app akfani shame"
"64","Waste of time"
"65","I never got a chance to view 8t because it took so long loading that my daughter would turn i5 off before 8t would load. Young toddlers do not have patience to wait that long for something to load."
"66","Waste of my mobile data, almost all rhyms, stories are locked. My child could not understand vocal sounds."
"67","This app is garbage"
"68","we want the old version again...cause the humpty dumpty can't be touched where it will have sounds"
"69","Well i thought this app was awsome until i found that you have to pay to have everything in the app, your discription is very misleading you should change it to 40 free songs etc, not over 1000 songs and games etc. This app shouldnt be in the free catagorie unless you change the name to 40 free songs etc."
"70","Soòooooooooooooooooooooooooo worse game"
"71","You just keep downloading each song afresh after downloading the full package. Very annoying!"
"72","All the things are locked I hate it"
"73","I hate this game ?????????"
"74","Thought this was a one off purchase, but it has been taking money from my account MONTHLY and we couldnt use it because it didnt work. Would like to apply for a refund please, or will take this complaint further."
"75","Its said free trial, but its already charged directly IDR10k. Though its not big amount, but I feel cheated. Also after payment success now apps cannot be open. You should revise it. Thanks"
"76","Hopeless app"

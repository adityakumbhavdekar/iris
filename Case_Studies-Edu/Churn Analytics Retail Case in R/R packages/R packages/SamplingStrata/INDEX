bethel                  Multivariate optimal allocation
buildStrataDF           Builds the "strata" dataframe containing
                        information on target variables Y's
                        distributions in the different strata, starting
                        from sample data or from a frame
checkInput              Checks the inputs to the package: dataframes
                        "errors", "strata" and "sampling frame"
errors                  Precision constraints (maximum CVs) as input
                        for Bethel allocation
evalSolution            Allows to evaluate the solution produced by the
                        function 'optimizeStrata' by selecting a number
                        of samples from the frame with the optimal
                        stratification, and calculating average CV's on
                        the target variables Y's together with
                        differences between estimates and the values of
                        the parameters in the population.
optimizeStrata          Best stratification of a sampling frame for
                        multipurpose surveys
selectSample            Selection of a stratified sample from the frame
                        with srswor method
strata                  Dataframe containing information on strata in
                        the frame
swisserrors             Precision constraints (maximum CVs) as input
                        for Bethel allocation
swissframe              Dataframe containing information on all units
                        in the population of reference that can be
                        considered as the final sampling unit (this
                        example is related to Swiss municipalities)
swissmunicipalities     The Swiss municipalities population
swissstrata             Dataframe containing information on strata in
                        the swiss municipalities frame
tuneParameters          Execution and compared evaluation of
                        optimization runs
updateFrame             Updates the initial frame on the basis of the
                        optimized stratification
updateStrata            Assigns new labels to atomic strata on the
                        basis of the optimized aggregated strata
var.bin                 Allows to transform a continuous variable into
                        a categorical ordinal one by applying a
                        modified version of the k-means clustering
                        function in the 'stats' package.
